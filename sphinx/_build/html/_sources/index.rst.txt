.. job_stream documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. Note that this file is necessary because of a bug in Sphinx where 'self' does not have section links; this file makes the TOC slightly better.
   The downside to this approach is that the sidebar is not expanded by default.

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    main.rst


.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    changelog.rst
    roadmap.rst
    Python API <python.rst>
